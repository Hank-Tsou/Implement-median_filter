# Median Filter
```
This project is trying to implement a Median filter
```
### Median Filter (Spatial Filter) 
```
Input image: input_image.jpg
Input filter size: " Must " be odd number

Command line >> python median_filter.py -i input_image.jpg -s 3
```

The program will show the result include original image and result image. In the figures below the first image is original image and then result image with filter size = 3, 5 and 7.
